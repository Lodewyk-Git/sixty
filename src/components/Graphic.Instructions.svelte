  Click on a number between one and six as randomly as possible to produce the kind of sequence
  you’d get if you really rolled a die, so that if another person is shown your sequence of digits
  from 1 to 6, he/she should not be able to tell whether these numbers were produced by a real die
  or just “made up” by somebody.

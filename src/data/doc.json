I’m sure thousands of people accepted it and moved on. But once our team started preparing the data for a fun guess-your-age experiment, we learned that you can’t always accept things on the surface, even from a peer-reviewed data-driven study, published in a respectable journal."},{"component":"Text","text":"We found that one tiny decision about what data to include or omit is the difference between “ah that is interesting” and “welp, nothing here.” The pivotal decision: the researchers chose to include “bad” responses. To us, a bad response meant that the participant either misunderstood the instructions, or intentionally sabotaged the experiment."},{"component":"Text","text":"From the original experiment: “You should try to produce a series of 12 events that look as random as possible. If somebody else sees the sequence you produce he/she should believe it has really been produced by tossing a coin.” Do you think a response of <strong>HHHHHHHHHHHH</strong> satisfies this criteria? We don’t. And this disagreement has a big statistical impact."},{"component":"Text","text":"Here is what their main chart looked like, including all responses.

A suggested pace is one tap per second.","warning":"⚠️ You can’t undo or go back."},{"component":"Test","index":"2","name":"roll","prompt":"Tap a sequence of <strong>10 dice rolls.</strong> Make it look as random as possible; another person should think it really happened."},{"component":"Test","index":"3","name":"spot","prompt":"Tap a sequence of <strong>10 spots.</strong> Make it look as random as possible; another person should think it really happened."},{"component":"Age","guess":"Thanks for playing!

To us, a bad response means the participant either misunderstood the instructions, or intentionally sabotaged the experiment.

This is normal since it takes significantly more time and effort to reproduce versus review. This means it is highly likely that the reviewers didn’t run their own data analysis either, which makes it far easier to miss a small but important decision like the one we found."},{"component":"Text","text":"The experiment at the start of this story was our attempt to do our own replication.

You can play again for fun if you want.","button":"Let’s do it","byline":"Created by <br><a href=https://pudding.cool/author/russell-goldenberg target=_blank>Russell</a> + <a href=https://pudding.cool/author/arjun-kakkar target=_blank>Arjun</a>","jump":"Just skip to results please"},{"component":"Test","index":"1","name":"toss","prompt":"Provide a series of <strong>12 coin flips.</strong>  Make it look as random as possible; another person should think it really happened.","instructions":"🗒️ This experiment investigates how humans produce and perceive randomness. It consists of three very short tasks related to chance. A suggested pace is one tap per second.","warning":"⚠️ You can’t undo or go back."},{"component":"Test","index":"2","name":"roll","prompt":"Provide a series of <strong>10 dice rolls.</strong> Make it look as random as possible; another person should think it really happened."},{"component":"Test","index":"3","name":"spot","prompt":"Provide a series of <strong>10 spots.</strong> Make it look as random as possible; another person should think it really happened."},{"component":"Age","guess":"Thanks for playing!

Pressure to publish lots of papers favors those who can put them together quickly — and one way to be quick is to be willing to cut corners.”"},{"component":"Text","text":"Instead of adding one more abstracted data point to the heap of reviewed studies, we want to show you just how easy it is to fall into this trap, and highlight how little decisions have big effects."},{"component":"Correct"},{"component":"Text","text":"Our issue with the study about randomness was the decision to include “bad” responses. To us, a bad response meant that the participant either misunderstood the instructions, or intentionally sabotaged the experiment. That decision was the difference between “ah this is interesting” and “welp, nothing here” (or “null results” in statistics lingo)."},{"component":"Text","text":"Here are the instructions from the original study:"},{"component":"Instructions"},{"component":"Text","text":"Here is an example of a <mark class=good>good</mark> and <mark class=bad>bad</mark> dice roll sequence based on their classifying algorithm."},{"component":"Bad"},{"component":"Text","text":"Do you think the bad response looks “real” and satisfies the instructions?

Your answer got a higher random score than X% of people in the study."},{"text":"When we add a trend line, we see their findings illustrated."},{"text":"Here are the bad responses. We even took a conservative approach to defining bad; just the ones that were entirely heads or tails."},{"text":"When we exclude the bad responses, the trend disappears."}]},{"component":"Text","text":"Although that example was just for the coin toss, the same holds true when you look at the aggregate results."},{"component":"Text","text":"One explanation for why this wasn’t caught was because the study was peer-reviewed, not replicated. A researcher confronted with their own raw data would be forced to reckon with the decision of bad response inclusion."},{"component":"Text","text":"The experiment at the start of this story was our attempt to do our own replication. Here are the live results of that process."},{"component":"Text","text":"Discuss how results are the same or different."},{"component":"Text","text":"The moral of the story: just because you read it on a New York Times headline doesn’t make it true. Oh, and if you are over 60, go ahead with the confidence that you can still be as random as you were in your 20s."}]}

Well, tons of news outlets covered this cool study from a legitimate journal propagating this idea into tens (or hundreds) of thousands of minds.

After 24”"},{"component":"Text","text":"Despite some fun watercooler fodder, this is more of a cautionary tale about our blind acceptance of “data-driven studies.” One little decision about what data to include or omit turned a research question into a truth."},{"component":"Text","text":"The inclusion in question: Should the  researchers have included “bad” responses.

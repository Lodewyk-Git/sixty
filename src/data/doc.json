It consists of three very short tasks related to chance.

By the way, we have guessed right 60% of the time so far. Better than we expected! [dynamic]"},{"component":"Text","text":"Our problem with the study was the decision to include “bad” responses. To us, a bad response meant that the participant either misunderstood the instructions, or intentionally sabotaged the experiment, and the difference between “ah that is interesting” and “welp, nothing here.”"},{"component":"Text","text":"The instructions from the original experiment: “You should try to produce a series of 12 events that look as random as possible.
